# Example presented during the January 2023 webinar.
The ACME employees can get a train ticket using a giftcard.
This example:
* uses a connector to query an external MySQL database
* demonstrates how to access the business and process data
* shows an example of an automatic validation

## How to use it?
* Always use 'master' branch to get the latest stable version.
* This project is configured to use 'dev' environment as default.
* You need to configure the connector on the TrainTicketRequest process, according to the database you want to connect to.
You can easily create a MySQL database running on localhost by following this tutorial: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/tutorial.html
